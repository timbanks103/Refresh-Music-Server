Restoring a library to managementment under the Mac OS Music app

1. Go to Music->Settings->Files-> Media location
    and identify the top level directory (which contains the "Automatically Add To Music" folder)

2. Set "Keep Media Folder organised" to On  and "Copy files to Media folder..." to on.

3. When the pop-up asks, Say "Yes" to allow Music to reorganise.   This will do Nothing.

4. Import all of the music files.

5. Use FIle -> Library -> Import Playlist to recover playlists previously exported.
    Note that it is not possible to export/import smart playlists; smart playlists are converted to static lists on export.
