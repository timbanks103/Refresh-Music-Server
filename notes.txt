Music Server Notes

The following settings are assumed for the 'Music' app

 o Keep Music Media folder organised.
 o Copy files to Music Media folder whenm adding to library
 o Import settings  AAC encoder 256kbps stereo

Music is kept on the 'Media' removeable disc and a preflight task in Carbon Copy Cloner makes a transcoding or copy of any
new or updated files so that all files are in mp3 format.  The cloner then copies any updates to the Music server.

THINGS TO DO

o DONE Some files in the Music collection are on the Internal drive rather than the Media external drive.  What does the menu item "File>Library>Organise Library"  do?  ""*Test out* Importing the Macintosh HD/timbanks/Music collection to detect and deleted files from that location.
  A script may be a better way to find the extent of the problem.
  
  This is done by comparing the internal drive collection weith the Media external drive via the anasylsis.py script.
  Repairs werere done manually.
  
   
o Compare the iTunes Music-retired with Music Library for missing/duplicate tracks and Folder.jpg
  For example:
   [All checked from Ab Kloster -> Colin Davis and also multi-disk albums (Piccini operas, Christmas Oratorio)  ]
   >********Except that Tosca has two sets of m4a files with one set suffixed "1" in the filename. These duplications are not identified by File>Library>Show Duplicate Items
       Maybe they Can be found by the 'find' command in the terminal window using pattern matching.
       OR BETTER - by a new script to facilitate repetition of the scan.
       
       DONE The analysis.py script looks for filenames ending " 1" and reports them.  The removal can be done by hand by removing the whole album and then re-adding it.
       
   >******* Note that the original files imported from CDs can be found on the mybooklive server at /shares/Public/Shared Music/Hidden-m4a/iTunes/Media  (or something like that)
  Done: This is done by  copying the Hidden-m4a archive to the Media volume and running findForgotten.py
  
o DONE Check that files removed from the Music app are removed from the server
  This may require a changed to the "Safety net" setting in CCC.

---------------- 31 March 2025
o Figure out what happened in removed.log
      
o Remove empty directories on the transcoding target file system

  Finally...
o Clean up the various copies of the library  - on Mac Hard disk, Media disk and on the server at /Public/Shared Music
